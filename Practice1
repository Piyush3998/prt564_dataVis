Tasks
T1. Refer to the Dollar-Kms spreadsheet shown on the previous page. Code the data manually into a Pandas dataframe.
T2. Plot a scatterplot to visualise the distribution of all data points of the spreadsheet. Expected output:
T3. Build a simple linear regression model based on the dataframe's data. Write down the linear regression equation. Also, visualise the regression line over the data points, such as shown below.
T4. Build another simple linear regression model based on the dataframe's data, but this time set the intercept to 0 (since not driving any distance at all should incur zero cost in petrol). Write down the linear regression equation and visualise the 2nd regression line over the data points:
T5. Finally, estimate the total petrol cost (in Dollars) for a 1,500km journey to Alice Springs. Compare the estimations made by both regression models.
